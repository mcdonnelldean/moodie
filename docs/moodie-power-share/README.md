# Moodie Power Share
The Moodie Power Share is a custom designed PCB used to share larger power supplies across multiple Moodie Controller Boards. In many cases appropriate final brightness calibrations mean that most installations use a lot less power than the supply can offer. In cases such as these, a power splitter can be used to share the power.

## Ratings
The key ratings for the board are:

- __Input Voltage:__ 5V
- __Max Draw:__ 5A
- __Max Continuous:__ 4A
