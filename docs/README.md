## Overview
Moodie is an a suite of hardware and software that enables you to add LED based lighting around your home, or office with ease. You can lighting to places such as,

- Behind TVs, monitors and displays
- Around mirrors and pictures
- Up stairs
- Around doors

To do.

### Making your own
Moodie does not come as a pre-made kit meaning you must buy and build the pieces yourself. Every part of Moodie has been designed to be easy to put together, regardless of prior experience. 

Assuming you already have parts, it should take no more than an afternoon to build the first board and App; further boards can be done in under thirty minutes.

#### Tools needed

- A smart phone with the ability to make app purchases
- A Multimeter
- A Soldering Kit, including an Iron and solder

#### Skills needed

- Basic soldering skills. Part count and size have been heavily considered when designing Moodie.
- 

#### Analog or Digital
Moodie comes in two flavours, digital - which supports 5V chipset driven LED'S, and analog - which supports 12V Transistor driven LED's.

## Moodie Kit
To keep Moodie as modular and simple as possible, the whole kit has been broken out into build-able or purchasable parts. Follow each section below to build out your own LED installation.

### Analog

#### Moodie Analog Controller
The Moodie Controller is a custom designed PCB which houses a WeMos D1 Mini as it's brain. The controller itself acts as a power path and strip connector for the D1 Mini. The parts list and soldering requirements have been kept as minimal as possible to keep the barrier to entry low.

#### Moodie Analog App
The Moodie App is a Blynk created application that can run on any modern smart phone. It can be used in the cloud or ran completely internally to your network should privacy be a concern.

### Extras

#### Moodie Lights
Moodie Lights is a catch all name for any supported 5V Digital LED, LED Array, or LED strip. This part of Moodie is essentially a purchasable part; with a ridiculously large variation to choose from.

#### Moodie Power Share
The Moodie Power Share is a custom designed PCB used to share larger power supplies across multiple Moodie Controller Boards. In many cases appropriate final brightness calibrations mean that most installations use a lot less power than the supply can offer. In cases such as these, a power splitter can be used to share the power.
